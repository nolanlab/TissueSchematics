There are two subfolders included:

CellHier:
This contains base code, published in Schuerch et al. Cell 2020 with
the algorithm for finding cellular neighborhoods

ipynb:
This contains the ipython notebooks used to perform the analyses in the paper:
cellularneighborhoods (figure 1)
spatial_contexts (figure 2)
assembly_rules (figure 3)
Figure4 - CRC spatial contexts
Figure5 - motifs etc in CRC, save MCMC analysis for triangles
mcmc_generating_samples - code used to call CPP library and generate samples
mcmc_validation_analysis - code used to find higher-order triangles and validate MCMC mixing


htmls:
Contains htmls of the crc analysis notebooks to look through, with all the analysis for each figure annotated.
